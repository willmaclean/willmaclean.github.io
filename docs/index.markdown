I am a data scientist currently working on AI for cardiac health. I research epistemic and semantic uncertainty in the language of radiology reporting. See my github for relevant code.

I am also interested in AI for ecology and bio-systems. What can we save...

Formerly a student of eighteenth-century philosophy. I am a lapsed arts student stumbling through STEM. I wrote a dissertation on the third Earl of Shaftesbury (1671-1713). I'm always up for a chat about the history of moral philosophy, eighteenth-century politics of land, the British abolition movement, and Bernard Williams. 

I maintain an email letter of dubious merit at walfred.substack.com.
