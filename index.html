<p>my name is will maclean</p>
<p>I am a data scientist researching linguistic AI in healthcare, currently working on classifying uncertainty in radiology reports. See my quite empty &nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/willmaclean">github</a>&nbsp;for more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I write an <a href="https://walfred.substack.com/">email letter</a>&nbsp;of dubious merit on a variety of things.</p>
<p>I have an MPhil in english literature and the history of philosophy (thesis on Shaftesbury). I'm interested in the history of philosophy, with a particular focus on the 18th century. I study how what counts as argument, persuasion, and understanding look different in different cultural and intellectual circumstances.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My other interests are jazz, cricket, wordsworth, and avfc. Some of these interests are reflected by my twitter: @w_amac.</p>
<p>my email is willmaclean 'at' gmail.com</p>
